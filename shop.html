	<h3>Shop stuff for sale</h3>
	<p>
	Make an offer on anything you want.
	I got it all for a good deal and will gladly pass those deals on!
	Text me at (314) 632-6656.
	</p>

	<p>
	There's more than what's pictured!
	If anything needs repairs, I will gladly do them but am also willing to sell a "project" for a lower price.
	</p>

	<p>
	Also available are some "things with engines": a motorized scooter, a push mower, a pressure washer, and a riding mower.
	</p>
