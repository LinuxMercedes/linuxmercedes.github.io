Ontology
--------
- Automated ontology learning for critical infrastructure setups
- Computationally detecting interdependencies between infrastructure
- Suggesting techniques for modifying current CI to reduce interdependencies/increase redundancy

Advantages:
- Machine Learning/NLP/ontology learning
- Ambitious

FOM
---
- Evolving recovery techniques based on FOM
- Methods for choosing FOMs
- Transforming FOMs to give better feedback?

Advantages:
- Potential for lots of EA and math proofs

Network Discoverability
-----------------------
- Use network probing techniques and side-channel attacks to learn infrastructure
- Probably not feasible without heavy smart grid instrumentation
- Provide some models to feed to ontology learning to find attack points for networks


Miscellaneous
-------------
- Apply/Extend Shawn's work
- Quantifying vulnerability of lines/stations/etc
