[15:04:08] <`lm`> I think I'm done with calc II
[15:08:24] <`lm`> It's almost all computation and memorizing patterns to match 
[15:08:57] <`lm`> No focus on why, or how to fit patterns together in new ways
[15:09:42] <`lm`> Thus every student gets lost halfway through series and sequences 
[15:10:30] <`lm`> Since that requires either a lot of arbitrary memorization OR an actual understanding 
[15:11:04] <`lm`> I wish mine was better; I'm only one step ahead of my students 
[15:11:54] <`lm`> (Abstraction wise; I have an intuition for why but little formal explanation) 
[15:12:56] <`lm`> I feel shit for grading these students hard when it is clear that only a handful have grasped the basics 
[15:13:36] <`lm`> And I cannot fault them entirely for it, they have been failed by high school and college teachers alike
[15:14:22] <`lm`> And there is little I can do in 10 minutes a week to fix that situation 
[15:17:01] <`lm`> To make matters worse, the notation is designed by people who understand it 
[15:17:31] <`lm`> So kids are taught to pattern match against notation that feels almost designed to confuse them 
[15:18:00] <`lm`> Because the notation is designed to be abstract and expressive rather than to aid memorization 
[15:18:36] <`lm`> But the latter is all they learn to do, and so this shit is even more confusing than necessary 
[15:19:14] <`lm`> I think I understand why every blog post on how math is stupid mentions notation 

[16:12:51] <`lm`> Lol
[16:39:02] <`lm`> Man school is such bullshit if it wasn't for bbeing homeschooled that taught me how to teach myself I would have fucking hated it
[16:39:48] <`lm`> English is all about following rules; an essay is intro, thesis, three points, conclusion. Did you explain your point?  Who cares
[16:41:01] <`lm`> Math, same deal. Did you get the right answer? Who cares if you don't understand why you got tthe answer or if you can explain the process you used to get the wrong one, the former is 100% Better than the latter
[16:41:23] <`lm`> =\
[16:42:06] <hmrgoodman> yeah  :-/
[16:44:32] <`lm`> Who cares about thinking, check the right boxes and you pass
[16:46:41] <`lm`> It takes 2 decades before most people have a chance to take a class the teacher cares about 
[16:48:59] <`lm`> Sorry for being a bummer
[16:49:21] <`lm`> I really do like academia but it needs a lot of work 
[16:49:53] <hmrgoodman> From the ground up
[16:50:26] <`lm`> Yeah. 
[16:50:52] <`lm`> I don't know what I want to do with mmy life 
[16:50:55] <`lm`> Well 
[16:51:05] <`lm`> I know exactly what I want to di
[16:51:23] <`lm`> I just don't know anywhere I can do that for a living
