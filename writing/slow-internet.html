<h2>On living with slow internet</h2>

- Details ping, speed, etc
- Tech stuff - irc, ziproxy, thunderbird, noscript/imglikeopera/adblock
- Impact
	- More time reading text
	- Twitter, no FB, social media
	- Internet overload/drama
	- git, etc / dev tools, docs, etc
- Griping
	- Non-accessible pages (no alt text/need image to navigate, etc)
	- Needing JS for things (no content/image background not set)
	- Lack of optimization (having to wait for js requests to time out before I can see anything)
	- AJAX that can't handle timed out/failed requests (see: not reddit)
- Minimalism in implementation
	- Basic website content should be visible without images, CSS, or JS
	- Don't use JS to load content you can have the browser load for you; that's reinventing the http request wheel and the browser is better at it than you are
	- Irony: minimal design requires a lot of images, JS, etc, which is hardly a minimal implementation
